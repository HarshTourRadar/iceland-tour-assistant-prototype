Your adventure kicks off with a welcome meeting at 6 pm at your accommodation.

From here head to the Geysir geothermal area, checking out Strokkur and watching as the geyser swells with blue water before erupting and shooting some 20-30 metres in the air.

You can feel its power up close with a strenuous walk up a windy set of stairs up to a stunning viewpoint. The black sands and bizarre, rectangular rock formations of Reynisfjara are up next. The last stop of the day is the famous Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon. Make sure you head down to Diamond Beach, where some of the icebergs are washed onto the black sand. Your leader can help you book an optional walk on the mottled blue, grey and black face of one of the tongues of Europe's largest glaciers, the epic ice cap of Vatnajokull. From Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon it is not far to our overnight stay, located on another lagoon that is sheltered by a black sandbar."

Then take a scenic drive along the rugged coast of the East Fjords. Enjoy spectacular views of high mountains, deep fjords, spectacular waterfalls, glaciers and quaint fishing villages. Make stops along the way at small but notable towns like Djupivogur, which became a member of the cittaslow movement in 2013 and is aiming to be the Happiest Town in Iceland, and drop by Egilsstadir, home to the mythic Lagarfljot Wyrm. Continue along mountain roads into the highland to the farm village of Modrudalur. At 469 metres (1539 feet) above sea level, Modrudalur is the highest inhabited place in Iceland, and snow can be seen almost year-round. Stretch your legs with a walk to the farm's church, built in 1949 by farmer Jon Adalsteinn Stefansson in memory of his wife. Spend the evening on this unique farm, which is small but rich in history."

Marvel at geothermal hot springs, witness the steamy eruptions of a giant geyser, touch the tongue of Europe's biggest glacier at Vatnajokull and cruise the Jokulsarlong Glacial Lagoon, see lava that's still warm after decades and witness the giant Skogafoss and Detifoss waterfalls in all their splendour. Travel through Iceland's isolated corners and the land of the famous Blue Lagoon \u2013 so mysterious and ethereal that they have inspired artists, poets and musicians for centuries. Plus, with a local leader on hand to answer any questions and get you from place to place, you\u2019ll be cruising around this icy isle in no time.<br /><br />A remote location and high-performing currency are just two reasons Iceland can be an expensive destination. This affects things like museum entrance fees and outdoor activities, but is especially noticeable when eating out. Your leader will be able to advise on how to save money, but in remote areas the only option for dinner will be at the guesthouse we are staying at. Please stock up on food at a supermarket prior to arrival if you would like to opt out eating at the guesthouse's restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe extremity of the weather makes for incredible scenery, but it also means Iceland can be very cold, especially at the start and end of the season and at night. Please bring appropriate clothing for adverse weather conditions. On the rare occasions your leader must alter the itinerary due to the weather which can cause roads being blocked, sites closure etc. Your leader will discuss the necessary changes and alternatives where possible.\r\n\r\nIn order to access what\u2019s off the beaten track, a few long drives are in order. This is a great opportunity to enjoy the scenery and spend some time getting to know the other members of your group.\r\n\r\nThe facilities will be shared in some of the guest houses that you stay on this trip.",

            "The tour was wonderful - it offered all the highlights and many different impressions and activities. Breathtaking waterfalls, vast landscapes, glaciers and icebergs, black beaches, secluded accommodations in unreal landscape and all this accompanied by an extremely friendly and good-humored tour guide.",
            "Good Itinerary and great guide. Overall a well organized and run trip. Enjoyed every bit of it.",
            "This was an amazing once in a lifetime trip. Truly fantastic. The small group size meant we got a lot of personalized attention, we got to see a lot of extra sites, and we stayed safe from Covid exposure. Our guide was pleasant, knowledgeable and fantastic to be around; just a great guy. I think everyone else on the tour was a repeat Intrepid/TourRadar customer. If you can, I\u2019d book one day extra in Reykjav\u00edk at both the beginning and end of the tour.",
            "The trip was wonderful! Iceland is well worth visiting.",
            "Incredible trip! Shame the itinerary is changing for 2020 as it\u2019s cutting out my 2 favorite stays on the trip. Still..I\u2019m not a tour person at all. I prefer off the beaten path, flexibility for unexpected adventures, etc. but J\u00f3nas provided all of this. He was the best!!!! As a avid single, female, I\u2019ve realized done a lot of solo travel but there are many places I\u2019d like to go that aren\u2019t the best choice for a single, solo, female traveler. However, now that I\u2019ve found f Intrepid Tours, the doors have opened and I am already looking at where to go next.",
            "Great tour. Enjoyed several upgrades, excellent food and tour guide kept us busy with extra bonus's including my favourite...the puffins",
            "Overall a great journey with a fantastic guide and wonderful experienced travelers. Stefan our guide was very friendly and knowledgeable about Iceland\u2019s history and natural resources. He masterfully and safety manuvered our bus through icy mountain roads and muddy trails to reach our daily objectives. Our accomodations were adequate and comfortable with complimentary breakfasts in the morning. Our guide made frequent rest stops and ensured our meal requirements were met with several options. He gave us sufficient time to explore each attraction after his explanation of their significance. He made a smooth transition to our accomodations each evening and assisted with luggage. Great communications and coordination between Tourradar/Intrepid Tours and the traveler. I will definately book another tour with you in the future!",
            "The poor rating is for Tour Radar, not for the actual Intrepid Iceland tour. Every request-email to Tour Radar prompted an automatic reply that there was unusually high traffic on their site and it may take days to get a response. Due to their poor communication, my friend and I lost out on a guesthouse accommodation they had promised us verbally on the phone. Once on the trip, others who had booked directly through Intrepid were notified of a meeting place change, but we never were. Would recommend booking any tour directly through the provider. I'll never use Tour Radar again. The Intrepid tour of Iceland was great. Our tour guide, Karl, was a native and took us to some special places that weren't even listed on the itinerary. He also shared a wealth of knowledge about his country and had a great sense of humor.",
            "Wonderful trip and I was matched with another nice travel companion/rom mate.Waterfalls were spectacular in June, but what the trip extra special was our local guide Harpa. She even invited the group to her family home to sample some typical Icelandic hors nibbles and home made drinks. Then she took us to visit the family horses! I would recommend this trip!",
            "The tour was well designed - we saw a variety of places and enjoyed a wide range of activities. The van was a convenient means of transportation, but the seats in the back row were cramped, with less leg room than between the other rows, and on the long drives it became very uncomfortable. The accommodation was excellent in most places, with clean and airy rooms. Exception: the large guesthouse in Siglufjordur, where the standard of cleanliness was lower, and the faucet in our room sink was stiff and very hard to use. The food was fresh, healthy, and tasty in all places. Stefan was knowledgeable, helpful in all situations, responsive to our needs, and personable. He also announced and implemented seat rotation."

His attention to detail, description of locations, local history and knowledge was a great added value. Food was delicious and satisfying. Would suggest limiting group size as we were a large group. Also, the description on tour radar could have more accurately described the hike - providing elevation/topograhic profiles to show the terrain would have been helpful. Despite some challenging weather - would definitely do this again. Have already recommended it to many people! This trek was a wonderful way to see some rugged and beautiful landscape and really get away from it all.",

The drive will take approximately four hours as we head through the south of Iceland, up the Thjorsardalur valley towards Mount Hekla, an enormous volcano responsible for enormous destruction in centuries past. Here, we turn into the Highlands and the black volcanic desert of the Fjallabak area. The Fjallabak Nature Reserve is one of the most popular areas in Iceland for trekking with a landscape like nowhere else, from black volcanic plains to multicoloured rhyolite mountains. At the heart of all this are the Landmannalaugar mountains, where we pitch our camp before having lunch.\r\n\r\nTypically, most trips begin the Laugavegur Trail today; however, we take the opportunity to enjoy a daywalk in these unique surroundings.\r\n\r\nOur afternoon walk heads to the top of Blue Peak and across the black Laugahruna lava field. The hot pools originate in this lava field, which was created in 1477, the last known eruption in the area.\r\n\r\nThis area is believed to be the southern end of the Bardarbunga volcanic system. The last eruption in the Bardarbunga system was a fissure eruption in the northern end from 2014 to 2015. Some 93mi (150km) north of Landmannalaugar, it was the largest eruption in Iceland for more than 200 years, though luckily did not have the same impact on air travel as the more famous Eyafjallajokull eruption of 2010.\r\n\r\nOur guide will prepare the evening meal in our mess tent, though group members are expected to pitch in and help with food preparation and washing up."

It is the largest rhyolitic area in Iceland, consisting of rolling rhyolite hills with numerous hot springs and sulphur vents.\r\n\r\nWe start by crossing the Laugahraun lava field to the slopes of Brennisteinsalda, known for its photogenic spectrum of colours. We take a short but very worthwhile detour to the top.\r\n\r\nEn route we pass the Storihver hot spring, cross the high plateau and enter the Hrafntinnusker area. Here steam rises from hundreds of vents\u00a0and our route passes numerous hot springs along the way.\r\n\r\nFrom Hrafntinnusker and across the Torfajokull Massif \u2013 the route meanders southwards and we hike past steaming hot springs and boiling mud pools before we start dropping down Jokultungur to the black volcanic plains west of the Myrdalsjokull glacier. The view is spectacular on a clear day with Myrdalsjokull and Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull glaciers in the foreground and the black volcanic landscape between. We enter a totally different landscape of Palagonite ridges and peaks with black volcanic plains and big glacier rivers all around. Our aim for the day is Alftavatn lake where we pitch our tents once more."

After the glacier walk, en route to Reykjavik we stop at Skogarfoss and Kvernufoss, two particularly photogenic waterfalls.

        "description": "Natural splendour, bountiful wildlife and a pioneering spirit all coalesce in the High Arctic, a region once reserved for only the hardiest of travellers but now open to anyone with a real yearning for adventure. Starting out from the isolated Spitsbergen outpost of Longyearbyen, this expedition heads down through the Arctic Circle, taking in the islands of the Svalbard Archipelago, the north-east coast of Greenland and the journey over the Denmark Strait to Iceland. Following in the proverbial wake of explorers past, you'll be treated to stunning sceneries of vast glacial walls, sprawling fjord systems and icebergs the size of skyscrapers. Time spent on the ship will include educational presentations on tales of polar exploration and seabird identification, while there'll be plenty of opportunities for spotting the region's famed wildlife during Zodiac excursions. This voyage across the Arctic Circle allows travellers to experience three different countries of the Arctic in a relatively short space of time.<br /><br />As you\u2019d expect, temperatures in the Arctic are very cold. A warm parka will be provided along with waterproof boots and unlimited hot drinks, but you should also bring base layers and lots of warm clothing. Please see the Essential Trip Information's 'Packing' section.\r\n\r\nWeather depending, you will be making regular excursions in a Zodiac boat to explore the local area and look for wildlife. It can get very cold and wet on the Zodiac, so make sure you are dressed appropriately and that you keep your camera safe and dry. Sturdy sea legs are needed as you make wet and dry landings from the boat, and on steep terrain, snow and other uneven surfaces. Some ships have a lot of stairs, so please hold on to the handrails if seas are rough.\r\n\r\nThe weather plays a pivotal part in this adventure and although there\u2019s an itinerary in place, there are no guarantees that you\u2019ll be able to do everything that is planned for. A level of flexibility and openness to embracing the unexpected are important in expedition travel, especially to such a remote area.\r\n\r\nThis trip takes places during the time of year that Spitsbergen enjoys 24-hour daylight. Just one of the benefits of this is that incredible wildlife can be seen at any time of the day \u2013 be prepared to be woken at any time so as to not miss out on exciting animal sightings.\r\n\r\nPolar bears are one of the most incredible and appealing animals on the planet, but they are also powerful predators with little fear of humans. Therefore it\u2019s necessary to be aware of the guidelines surrounding any contact with Polar bears. Follow your leader\u2019s instructions and do not stray from your group \u2013 your leader carries equipment to protect you.",

We couldn\u2018t do the whale watching necause of the bad weather but he thought about a backup plan to enjoy the day at a museum. Really a beautiful experience that I absolutly can recommend! I even more fell in love with Iceland! Thank you Hjalti for making this Tour the best of our lifetime!",
            "Adolf is an amazing guide. Couldn't have had a better time if I tried! Amazing country and I will be back!",
            "Loved every second of the tour,gunnar the guide was excellent, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. And the group was just a good size to make friends.",
            "My husband and I were on our honeymoon on this trip, and we had an absolutely amazing time! TourRadar did a great job with communicating prior to our trip and answering any questions we had prior to our trip. We were also able to communicate with the tour company via the platform, which was very helpful. We got to visit so many amazing sites all around Iceland and made some amazing memories. The itinerary was well-developed and also allowed for some downtime. Our tour guide, Siggie, from Arctic Adventures also did an incredible job keeping us informed and making sure we had everything we needed. We were able to learn a lot and felt very welcomed.",
            "This tour was amazing. We were very fortunate to have clear skies for most of our trip, With breathtaking sunrises and sunsets. We even got to see the Northern Lights a couple of times. Our tour guide Sindri was wonderful, giving excellent local information around the whole island. Unfortunately the weather turned and we did not get to experience the whale watching tour, but the sites we did get to see more than made up for what we didn\u2019t get to see. I cannot wait to come back to Iceland it is a magical experience",
            "The guided tour was really nice but also exhausting. We have seen a lot, even some things that were not on the plan, thanks to our guide Vjeran.",
            "Overall very thorough cover of Iceland. Guide Vjeran very caring, considerate and humorous, doing his best in explaining and leading to each destination spot with good knowledge background. Well recommended.",
            "Our tour guide was the greatest ever. He went out of his way to accommodate everyone. He knowledge of Iceland was phenomenal! It was the most interesting trip I have ever taken",
            "Beautiful country. Great tour. Informative guide. Fun people."

Don\u2019t stand downwind if you don\u2019t want a hot shower! Then it\u2019s on to Gullfoss (the Golden Waterfall) where, on a sunny day, you can see rainbows shimmer in the spray above the waterfall. Next up take part in one of Iceland\u2019s most celebrated activities during a visit to the Blue Lagoon, a geothermal spa surrounded by a black lava field. Its warm waters are rich in minerals and silica mud, said to cleanse and soften the skin. Sit back and enjoy a relaxing soak against a remarkable mountain backdrop. Drive back to Reykjavik for a short tour with your leader to get to know the main sights of this eclectic city. The evening is free for you to explore the streets of Iceland\u2019s capital \u2013 you may like to join your group for a final dinner together to round off your adventure."

See the highlights of Iceland with expert local knowledge and time to explore \u2013 you\u2019ll get a true taste of this Northern European outpost.<br /><br />Iceland can be very cold at any time of year, so it's important to bring appropriate clothing. On the rare occasion that your leader has to alter the itinerary due to adverse weather, alternative activities will be offered.\r\n\r\nMany locations on this itinerary are remote, which means a few long drives of around 6 hours. This is a great opportunity to enjoy the scenery and spend some time getting to know your fellow travellers. Of course, you will stop frequently for photo opportunities.",

Continue on to the Geysir Geothermal Area and check out the Strokkur Geyser \u2013 it swells with blue water before erupting and shooting a spout some 20\u201330 metres in the air. Finally, witness the sheer power of the Gullfoss (Golden) Waterfall on the Hvita River. You'll even get a chance to stop by Secret Lagoon, a natural hot pool that will beckon you to take a dip, on your way to tonight's accommodation. After your Golden Circle tour, head to your stay in the Hvolsvollur region for the evening. This guesthouse is a leader in local responsible tourism and sustainability. The owners started a tree planting project on their land to contribute to lowering atmospheric carbon dioxide and counteract soil erosion.

Choose whether to join an optional hike over the glacier tongue \u2013 no experience is necessary. It\u2019s sobering to think that the glacier is retreating due to rising world temperatures and may soon be gone. If you don't want to take the glacier walk, perhaps explore the area around the glacier tongue. Alternatively, Skogafoss waterfall has a number of walking trails, or you can visit the Skogar folk museum. Along today's drive you'll get to check out the Laki Lava fields as you continue along Iceland's South Shore, spotting bird colonies on the promontory of Dyrholaey, Iceland's southernmost point. You\u2019ll also see the amazing stepping-stone rock formations of Reynisdrangar and its black sand beach, Reynisfjara. Continue to your overnight stop in the countryside near Reynivellir."

            "This tour is highly recommended as it provides an excellent taste of beautiful Iceland. Our tour guide, Vilhjalmur, was informative and a pleasure to interact with.",
            "The tour was great! Our tour guide Jonas went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed, safe, and comfortable. I would recommend this tour to anyone who wants to have a quick glimpse of key spots in Iceland in a short time. We were also very lucky to get a wonderful group of fellow travelers. People matter!",
            "Great value for once in a lifetime of experiences in other worldly environments. You\u2019d pay much more for the same trip even with the same tour operator.",
            "Paulina was excellent in all she told us, planned for us, just excellent in everything",
            "Good trip, good guide",
            "Loved your country. Our guide , Pall. was extremely knowledgeable and presented information in great story form. Definitely want to return for more.",
            "Excellent trip that fit all the highlights of Iceland into 3 days, from glacier hikes to lagoon rides and lava fields, while not feeling rushed. Note most excursions are optional add ons. The free day on either side of the driving days was great as we were able to explore more. Tour guide was very knowledgeable, friendly and passionate about Iceland. The small size of the tour was great as we got to know each other and become good mates over the few days. Highly recommend this tour for those wanting to see as much of Iceland in a few days."

Our first task is to paddle across the bay to the South side near H&ouml;f&eth;i to get a good look at Leirufj&ouml;r&eth;ur Fjord with Drangj&ouml;kull Glacier in the distance. Leirufj&ouml;r&eth;ur (e. Silt Fjord). The name of the fjord explains itself when we see the clay and silt coming from the glacier river of Drangaj&ouml;kull Glacier. We then head along the shoreline towards Grunnav&iacute;k Bay. En-route is a nice rock arch that we can pass under on high tide. There is also a good chance to spot porpoises close to the coast, especially if the sea is calm. In Grunnav&iacute;k there are a few summerhouses and a nice church that we can take a look at.

The island is inhabited by one family during the summer months and is a nice place to stop, relax and enjoy life on the island while ashore. The waters around the island is covered with puffins and other sea birds. Literally! After visiting the island, we do a long crossing (9 km) to the island of Vigur. The birdlife on the island is quite amazing and the farmers have raised special rock walls for the eider ducks to nest. Puffins are found all over the island. The beautiful and colorful houses are very picturesque and the small coffee house is a great place to stop by and relax. After about two hours on the island, we get going again for the last leg of the trip. Depending on weather, we&#39;ll paddle about 6 km to Hvitanes or to the village of S&uacute;&eth;av&iacute;k if conditions are good, where a car will pick us up. Drive back to &Iacute;safj&ouml;r&eth;ur. We&#39;ll arrive in &Iacute;safj&ouml;r&eth;ur in time for the afternoon flight for those flying back to Reykjav&iacute;k. We urge you to stay at least one night in &Iacute;safj&ouml;r&eth;ur and get to know this old and beautiful town. There are many interesting sites and nice walks in the mountains around the fjord that are definitely worth it.</p><p>Distance: 20-22 km.</p><p>This description gives only a brief overview and might be changed by the guide, depending on weather and other conditions."
