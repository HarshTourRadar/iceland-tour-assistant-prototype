Your adventure kicks off with a welcome meeting at 6 pm at your accommodation.

If you wish to spend more time in Reykjavik, we'll be happy to book additional accommodation for you (subject to availability). Please speak to your booking agent at the time of booking. Perhaps browse some of the city's great art galleries. If you feel like something more active, book yourself on a Silfra Fissure snorkelling adventure, where you\u2019ll discover this underwater ridge with water visibility of up to 120 metres. Alternatively, while away the hours with a soak in the geothermal waters of the famous Blue Lagoon."

  "description": "Travel to Iceland and delve into the ancient tales of Vikings and volcanoes on this eight-day adventure to its heartlands. Marvel at geothermal hot springs, witness the steamy eruptions of a giant geyser, touch the tongue of Europe's biggest glacier at Vatnajokull and cruise the Jokulsarlong Glacial Lagoon, see lava that's still warm after decades and witness the giant Skogafoss and Detifoss waterfalls in all their splendour. Travel through Iceland's isolated corners and the land of the famous Blue Lagoon \u2013 so mysterious and ethereal that they have inspired artists, poets and musicians for centuries. Plus, with a local leader on hand to answer any questions and get you from place to place, you\u2019ll be cruising around this icy isle in no time.<br /><br />A remote location and high-performing currency are just two reasons Iceland can be an expensive destination. This affects things like museum entrance fees and outdoor activities, but is especially noticeable when eating out. Your leader will be able to advise on how to save money, but in remote areas the only option for dinner will be at the guesthouse we are staying at. Please stock up on food at a supermarket prior to arrival if you would like to opt out eating at the guesthouse's restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe extremity of the weather makes for incredible scenery, but it also means Iceland can be very cold, especially at the start and end of the season and at night. Please bring appropriate clothing for adverse weather conditions. On the rare occasions your leader must alter the itinerary due to the weather which can cause roads being blocked, sites closure etc. Your leader will discuss the necessary changes and alternatives where possible.\r\n\r\nIn order to access what\u2019s off the beaten track, a few long drives are in order. This is a great opportunity to enjoy the scenery and spend some time getting to know the other members of your group.\r\n\r\nThe facilities will be shared in some of the guest houses that you stay on this trip.",

    "The tour was wonderful - it offered all the highlights and many different impressions and activities. Breathtaking waterfalls, vast landscapes, glaciers and icebergs, black beaches, secluded accommodations in unreal landscape and all this accompanied by an extremely friendly and good-humored tour guide.",
    "Good Itinerary and great guide. Overall a well organized and run trip. Enjoyed every bit of it.",
    "This was an amazing once in a lifetime trip. Truly fantastic. The small group size meant we got a lot of personalized attention, we got to see a lot of extra sites, and we stayed safe from Covid exposure. Our guide was pleasant, knowledgeable and fantastic to be around; just a great guy. I think everyone else on the tour was a repeat Intrepid/TourRadar customer. If you can, I\u2019d book one day extra in Reykjav\u00edk at both the beginning and end of the tour.",
    "The trip was wonderful! Iceland is well worth visiting.",
    "Incredible trip! Shame the itinerary is changing for 2020 as it\u2019s cutting out my 2 favorite stays on the trip. Still..I\u2019m not a tour person at all. I prefer off the beaten path, flexibility for unexpected adventures, etc. but J\u00f3nas provided all of this. He was the best!!!! As a avid single, female, I\u2019ve realized done a lot of solo travel but there are many places I\u2019d like to go that aren\u2019t the best choice for a single, solo, female traveler. However, now that I\u2019ve found f Intrepid Tours, the doors have opened and I am already looking at where to go next.",
    "Great tour. Enjoyed several upgrades, excellent food and tour guide kept us busy with extra bonus's including my favourite...the puffins",
    "Overall a great journey with a fantastic guide and wonderful experienced travelers. Stefan our guide was very friendly and knowledgeable about Iceland\u2019s history and natural resources. He masterfully and safety manuvered our bus through icy mountain roads and muddy trails to reach our daily objectives. Our accomodations were adequate and comfortable with complimentary breakfasts in the morning. Our guide made frequent rest stops and ensured our meal requirements were met with several options. He gave us sufficient time to explore each attraction after his explanation of their significance. He made a smooth transition to our accomodations each evening and assisted with luggage. Great communications and coordination between Tourradar/Intrepid Tours and the traveler. I will definately book another tour with you in the future!",
    "The poor rating is for Tour Radar, not for the actual Intrepid Iceland tour. Every request-email to Tour Radar prompted an automatic reply that there was unusually high traffic on their site and it may take days to get a response. Due to their poor communication, my friend and I lost out on a guesthouse accommodation they had promised us verbally on the phone. Once on the trip, others who had booked directly through Intrepid were notified of a meeting place change, but we never were. Would recommend booking any tour directly through the provider. I'll never use Tour Radar again. The Intrepid tour of Iceland was great. Our tour guide, Karl, was a native and took us to some special places that weren't even listed on the itinerary. He also shared a wealth of knowledge about his country and had a great sense of humor.",
    "Wonderful trip and I was matched with another nice travel companion/rom mate.Waterfalls were spectacular in June, but what the trip extra special was our local guide Harpa. She even invited the group to her family home to sample some typical Icelandic hors nibbles and home made drinks. Then she took us to visit the family horses! I would recommend this trip!",
    "The tour was well designed - we saw a variety of places and enjoyed a wide range of activities. The van was a convenient means of transportation, but the seats in the back row were cramped, with less leg room than between the other rows, and on the long drives it became very uncomfortable. The accommodation was excellent in most places, with clean and airy rooms. Exception: the large guesthouse in Siglufjordur, where the standard of cleanliness was lower, and the faucet in our room sink was stiff and very hard to use. The food was fresh, healthy, and tasty in all places. Stefan was knowledgeable, helpful in all situations, responsive to our needs, and personable. He also announced and implemented seat rotation."
