    "The Tour was amazing we had so much fun an visited so many places!! Our Guide Hjalti was the best Guide we could dream off! We couldn\u2018t do the whale watching necause of the bad weather but he thought about a backup plan to enjoy the day at a museum. Really a beautiful experience that I absolutly can recommend! I even more fell in love with Iceland! Thank you Hjalti for making this Tour the best of our lifetime!",
    "Adolf is an amazing guide. Couldn't have had a better time if I tried! Amazing country and I will be back!",
    "Loved every second of the tour,gunnar the guide was excellent, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. And the group was just a good size to make friends.",
    "My husband and I were on our honeymoon on this trip, and we had an absolutely amazing time! TourRadar did a great job with communicating prior to our trip and answering any questions we had prior to our trip. We were also able to communicate with the tour company via the platform, which was very helpful. We got to visit so many amazing sites all around Iceland and made some amazing memories. The itinerary was well-developed and also allowed for some downtime. Our tour guide, Siggie, from Arctic Adventures also did an incredible job keeping us informed and making sure we had everything we needed. We were able to learn a lot and felt very welcomed.",
    "This tour was amazing. We were very fortunate to have clear skies for most of our trip, With breathtaking sunrises and sunsets. We even got to see the Northern Lights a couple of times. Our tour guide Sindri was wonderful, giving excellent local information around the whole island. Unfortunately the weather turned and we did not get to experience the whale watching tour, but the sites we did get to see more than made up for what we didn\u2019t get to see. I cannot wait to come back to Iceland it is a magical experience",
    "The guided tour was really nice but also exhausting. We have seen a lot, even some things that were not on the plan, thanks to our guide Vjeran.",
    "Overall very thorough cover of Iceland. Guide Vjeran very caring, considerate and humorous, doing his best in explaining and leading to each destination spot with good knowledge background. Well recommended.",
    "Our tour guide was the greatest ever. He went out of his way to accommodate everyone. He knowledge of Iceland was phenomenal! It was the most interesting trip I have ever taken",
    "Beautiful country. Great tour. Informative guide. Fun people."
