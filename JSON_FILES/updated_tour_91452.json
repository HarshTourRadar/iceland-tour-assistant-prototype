  "description": "Explore the beautifully rugged landscapes of Iceland\u2019s western peninsulas with soaring coastal cliffs, centuries-old volcanic glaciers and idyllic waterfalls on a nine-day Premium adventure. Enjoy a boat cruise between icebergs at Glacier Lagoon, trek around vast waterside craters, visit local artisans in Grundarfjordur and charming fishing villages, and dip your toes in the Arctic Ocean. See the highlights of Iceland with expert local knowledge and time to explore \u2013 you\u2019ll get a true taste of this Northern European outpost.<br /><br />Iceland can be very cold at any time of year, so it's important to bring appropriate clothing. On the rare occasion that your leader has to alter the itinerary due to adverse weather, alternative activities will be offered.\r\n\r\nMany locations on this itinerary are remote, which means a few long drives of around 6 hours. This is a great opportunity to enjoy the scenery and spend some time getting to know your fellow travellers. Of course, you will stop frequently for photo opportunities.",
