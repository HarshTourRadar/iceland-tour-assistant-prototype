The city sees around four hours of sunlight a day in winter and 22 hours or more in summer. Surrounded by volcanic peaks and crystalline ocean, and boasting a vibrant arts and nightlife scene, Reykjavik's contrasts are utterly beguiling. Why not arrive early and head to the National Museum, which depicts the history of Iceland from the ninth century (when the first Vikings from mainland Scandinavia arrived and settled) to the present day, or join locals who gossip and chatter in the Laugardalslaug Geothermal Pool."

Continue on to the Geysir Geothermal Area and check out the Strokkur Geyser \u2013 it swells with blue water before erupting and shooting a spout some 20\u201330 metres in the air. Finally, witness the sheer power of the Gullfoss (Golden) Waterfall on the Hvita River. You'll even get a chance to stop by Secret Lagoon, a natural hot pool that will beckon you to take a dip, on your way to tonight's accommodation. After your Golden Circle tour, head to your stay in the Hvolsvollur region for the evening. This guesthouse is a leader in local responsible tourism and sustainability. The owners started a tree planting project on their land to contribute to lowering atmospheric carbon dioxide and counteract soil erosion. Tonight, you\u2019ll have the option to join the effort and head out into the hills surrounding the property to plant trees yourself."

Get up close and feel its power, then climb a long and windy set of stairs to a stunning viewpoint. Next up is one of Europe's biggest ice caps \u2013 Myrdalsjokull \u2013 which covers the active volcano Katla. Choose whether to join an optional hike over the glacier tongue \u2013 no experience is necessary. It\u2019s sobering to think that the glacier is retreating due to rising world temperatures and may soon be gone. If you don't want to take the glacier walk, perhaps explore the area around the glacier tongue. Alternatively, Skogafoss waterfall has a number of walking trails, or you can visit the Skogar folk museum. Along today's drive you'll get to check out the Laki Lava fields as you continue along Iceland's South Shore, spotting bird colonies on the promontory of Dyrholaey, Iceland's southernmost point. You\u2019ll also see the amazing stepping-stone rock formations of Reynisdrangar and its black sand beach, Reynisfjara. Continue to your overnight stop in the countryside near Reynivellir."

In the afternoon, complete your southerly loop by heading back to Reykjavik with a quick stop at Seljalandsfoss on your way. On arrival in Reykjavik, join your local leader for a short guided walk of the capital to visit the old harbour, city centre and snap some photos of Hallgrimskirkja church. The evening is free for you to enjoy all the capital has to offer, so why not get your group together for dinner! Perhaps, stop in Reykjavik`s most famous hot dog stand B\u00e6jarins Beztu Pylsur on the main square or head over to one of the many bars in town serving Icelandic craft beers."

    "It was very informative. The sites spectacular.",
    "It was an amazing trip. Our guide Stefan made it a wonderful adventure. Beautiful picturesque landscapes! It was great to sit back and just enjoy it while Stefan drove and organized our days according to weather so we got the best experience.",
    "Perfect opportunity to see the South of Iceland with ease. Margret was a great guide and everything ran perfectly. Most of all I met a wonderful group of people who I\u2019m looking forward to keeping in touch with!",
    "This tour is highly recommended as it provides an excellent taste of beautiful Iceland. Our tour guide, Vilhjalmur, was informative and a pleasure to interact with.",
    "The tour was great! Our tour guide Jonas went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed, safe, and comfortable. I would recommend this tour to anyone who wants to have a quick glimpse of key spots in Iceland in a short time. We were also very lucky to get a wonderful group of fellow travelers. People matter!",
    "Great value for once in a lifetime of experiences in other worldly environments. You\u2019d pay much more for the same trip even with the same tour operator.",
    "Paulina was excellent in all she told us, planned for us, just excellent in everything",
    "Good trip, good guide",
    "Loved your country. Our guide , Pall. was extremely knowledgeable and presented information in great story form. Definitely want to return for more.",
    "Excellent trip that fit all the highlights of Iceland into 3 days, from glacier hikes to lagoon rides and lava fields, while not feeling rushed. Note most excursions are optional add ons. The free day on either side of the driving days was great as we were able to explore more. Tour guide was very knowledgeable, friendly and passionate about Iceland. The small size of the tour was great as we got to know each other and become good mates over the few days. Highly recommend this tour for those wanting to see as much of Iceland in a few days."
