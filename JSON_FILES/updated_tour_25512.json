    "The group was professional and informative. The trek itself was dramatic and spectacular, as if being on another planet",
    "Great trip...;leader was well versed in history and culture of Iceland....well planned out",
    "The hike was beautiful and very well organized. Our guide - Yonn - did an amazing job of keeping a large group organized and coordinated. His attention to detail, description of locations, local history and knowledge was a great added value. Food was delicious and satisfying. Would suggest limiting group size as we were a large group. Also, the description on tour radar could have more accurately described the hike - providing elevation/topograhic profiles to show the terrain would have been helpful. Despite some challenging weather - would definitely do this again. Have already recommended it to many people! This trek was a wonderful way to see some rugged and beautiful landscape and really get away from it all.",
    "Solvi was great! Very prepared and informative. Also had a great way of dealing with some of the more challenging people/situations on our tour.",

    "Our guide was excellent. We really enjoyed her company during the trek. Well organised and informative. What we liked best was the varied and interesting landscape, the Icelandic salmon and lamb dinners prepared by our guides and the comradery with the guide and the group during the trek. We even liked the river crossings."
