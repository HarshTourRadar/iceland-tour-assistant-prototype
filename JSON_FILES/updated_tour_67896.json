  "description": "Natural splendour, bountiful wildlife and a pioneering spirit all coalesce in the High Arctic, a region once reserved for only the hardiest of travellers but now open to anyone with a real yearning for adventure. Starting out from the isolated Spitsbergen outpost of Longyearbyen, this expedition heads down through the Arctic Circle, taking in the islands of the Svalbard Archipelago, the north-east coast of Greenland and the journey over the Denmark Strait to Iceland. Following in the proverbial wake of explorers past, you'll be treated to stunning sceneries of vast glacial walls, sprawling fjord systems and icebergs the size of skyscrapers. Time spent on the ship will include educational presentations on tales of polar exploration and seabird identification, while there'll be plenty of opportunities for spotting the region's famed wildlife during Zodiac excursions. This voyage across the Arctic Circle allows travellers to experience three different countries of the Arctic in a relatively short space of time.<br /><br />As you\u2019d expect, temperatures in the Arctic are very cold. A warm parka will be provided along with waterproof boots and unlimited hot drinks, but you should also bring base layers and lots of warm clothing. Please see the Essential Trip Information's 'Packing' section.\r\n\r\nWeather depending, you will be making regular excursions in a Zodiac boat to explore the local area and look for wildlife. It can get very cold and wet on the Zodiac, so make sure you are dressed appropriately and that you keep your camera safe and dry. Sturdy sea legs are needed as you make wet and dry landings from the boat, and on steep terrain, snow and other uneven surfaces. Some ships have a lot of stairs, so please hold on to the handrails if seas are rough.\r\n\r\nThe weather plays a pivotal part in this adventure and although there\u2019s an itinerary in place, there are no guarantees that you\u2019ll be able to do everything that is planned for. A level of flexibility and openness to embracing the unexpected are important in expedition travel, especially to such a remote area.\r\n\r\nThis trip takes places during the time of year that Spitsbergen enjoys 24-hour daylight. Just one of the benefits of this is that incredible wildlife can be seen at any time of the day \u2013 be prepared to be woken at any time so as to not miss out on exciting animal sightings.\r\n\r\nPolar bears are one of the most incredible and appealing animals on the planet, but they are also powerful predators with little fear of humans. Therefore it\u2019s necessary to be aware of the guidelines surrounding any contact with Polar bears. Follow your leader\u2019s instructions and do not stray from your group \u2013 your leader carries equipment to protect you.",
